# RecoverIt
RecoverIt is a data recovery module for Roblox to help gain access to lost DataStores.

RecoverIt works by using a password system for accesing data stores.

When users join the game, their UserId is associated in a key, which has a password that the user can set.
In the event that a user's account has been lost or terminated, they can enter a password and RecoverIt can be used to recover the DataStore.
